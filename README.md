# LowCodeDocumentationGuidelines

![header-image](media/undraw_Setup_wizard_re_nday.png)

Space for #PowerAddicts to collaborate on Documentation Guidelines for Low Code technologies including:

* Power Apps
* Power Automate
* Power BI
* Power Virtual Agents
* Adaptive Cards
* and more

This is not limited to Microsoft Power Platform, but will include adjacent scenarios and services as well. 

## First thoughts

* lack of guidance on why and how to document Low Code solutions leads to technical debt
* it also leaves a bad impression of makers and their applications
* it's unfortunately supporting the perception of traditional developers, that low code solutions are only good for rapid prototyping or personal scope apps, but not enterprise grade solutions
Developing a framework on

1. how to document

* dependencies
* data model
* requirements regarding
  * hardware
  * licensing
  * resources
  * deployment process

2. how to use semantic versioning

3. how to comment code

will not only improve maintainability and supportability of solutions and therefore increase their lifecycle, but also improve both user and developer satisfaction.
